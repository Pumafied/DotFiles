DotFiles
========
These are Austin Lubker's DotFiles. Some resources have been taken for else where and will be marked as such at the top of the file
Special thanks to Nick Nisi for allowing me to build off his dot files


Be sure to run the ruby file to set up all of the vim plugins.
Use ln to symbolic link these into your dotfiles to use
